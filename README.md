# bitcoin-testnet-box

This is a private, difficulty 1 testnet in a box.

The master branch is meant for bitcoind v0.8.0. 
Check the tags for other bitcoind versions.

You must have bitcoind installed on your system and in the path.

## Starting the testnet-box

This will start-up two nodes using the two datadirs `1` and `2`. They
will only connect to each other in order to remain an isolated private testnet.
You need two because otherwise the node won't generate blocks.

Node `1` will listen on port `19000`, allowing node `2` to connect to it.

Node `1` will listen on port `19001` and node `2` will listen on port `19011` 
for the JSON-RPC server.


```
$ make start
```

## Check the status of the nodes

```
$ make getinfo
bitcoind -datadir=1  getinfo
{
    "version" : 80000,
    "protocolversion" : 70001,
    "walletversion" : 60000,
    "balance" : 0.00000000,
    "blocks" : 55922,
    "connections" : 1,
    "proxy" : "",
    "difficulty" : 1.00000000,
    "testnet" : true,
    "keypoololdest" : 1362643839,
    "keypoolsize" : 101,
    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
    "errors" : ""
}
bitcoind -datadir=2  getinfo
{
    "version" : 80000,
    "protocolversion" : 70001,
    "walletversion" : 60000,
    "balance" : 0.00000000,
    "blocks" : 55922,
    "connections" : 1,
    "proxy" : "",
    "difficulty" : 1.00000000,
    "testnet" : true,
    "keypoololdest" : 1362643615,
    "keypoolsize" : 101,
    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
    "errors" : ""
}
```

## Generating blocks

You may be interested in making it easier to mine for testing purposes
on your own private testnet.
An [easy-mining](https://github.com/freewil/bitcoin/tree/easy-mining)
branch of bitcoind is maintained for this purpose. You will need to
compile it yourself. You should only use the output binary for your own
private testnet.

To start generating blocks:

```
$ make generate-true
```
  
To stop generating blocks:

```
$ make generate-false
```
  
## Stopping the testnet-box
  
```
$ make stop
```
  
To clean up any files created while running the testnet and restore to the 
original state:

```
$ make clean
```
